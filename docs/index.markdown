**<font size = 5> Current Project: Post-Doc Position </font>**

**<center><font size = 4 > Test-Time Adaptation for Crop Mapping on Satellite Image Time Series with Deep Learning </font></center>**


<div style="text-align: justify">

The current project is related to a novel research field compared with my thesis work. Indeed, I am involved in the crop mapping of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) with Deep Learning models while adapting to new geographical domains. The peculiarities of these works are two major contraints: 

<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li> First, the SITS belonging to new geographical domains are not annotated </li>
<li> Second, the data from the source domain and target domain cannot be used jointly: source data are only available for pre-training the network and the adaptation should be applied at "test-time" </li>
</ul>

These two constraints necessitate the developpement of so-called "Test-Time Adaptation" (TTA) strategies to retrain the network unsupervisely with target data and improve the performance. 
Since SITS are exploited, both spatial and temporal shift can occur from an domain to another which makes the adaptation even more challenging.

**<font size = 5> Current Project: PhD Thesis </font>**

**<center><font size = 4 > Deep Learning for Multimodal Detection of Sudden and Slow Moving Slope Instabilities on Bitemporal Remote Sensing Images </font></center>**


<div style="text-align: justify">

The topic of the researches targets slope instability detections from remote sensing images by using deep learning approaches. Both sudden and slow moving phenomena are of interest in the thesis requiring the implementation of several deep learning techniques. Among them, the major contributions lie in radar-optical modality translation for weather robust detections, leveraging land-cover classification to increase translation reliability, apply multimodal slide detections algorithms within a missing modality context, create a new InSAR dataset or introduce explainability within the networks.
