From the 7th to the 12th July 2024, I had the opportunity to participate to the IGARSS 2024 conference in Athens.
Apart from enjoying the city, the Parthenon, the Dionysos amphitheater (photo) and typical Greek gastronomy, two major events motivated my participation to the conference.

First, I have the pleasure to anounce that our recent work about the impact of different DEM-SAR fusion strategies on the SAR-to-optical translation of SARDINet [1] has been accepted for publication in the conference.
These works explore the use of early and late fusion but also a progressive fusion based on separable convolutions to improve the translation of SARDINet and ensure more relevant patterns in distorted mountainous regions. 
The paper can be found on the following link: <a href ="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10641788">DEM-Assisted Neural Network for SAR-to-Optical Image Translation</a> and the code will be made available in the future.

Second, the proposed contributions are accompanied with a novel dataset for exploring modality translations in regions where SAR data show strong distortions. 
The dataset is composed of more than 50,000 triplets of STRM DEM, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images and is already available on IEEE Dataport via the following link: <a href ="https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/sar-dem-optical-mountainous-dataset-distortion-management"> SAR-DEM-Optical Mountainous Dataset for Distortion Management </a>.

Finally, it was a great honor for me to participate as chairman in two different oral sessions of the conference: Data Fusion and Temporal Data Analysis: SAR and Multimodal Change Detection.
It was a great opportunity to make new connections and discover more in depth the works proposed in these two sessions.
