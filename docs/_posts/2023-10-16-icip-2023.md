From the 9th to the 11th October 2023, I had the opportunity to assist to the International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia).

<div style="text-align: justify">
As entitled, the conference explored all of the applications of image processing and gathered researches and PhD students from all over the world. Remote sensing, medical imaging, graph analysis, video processing, machine and deep learning and so many other fields were shining all through the conference.

This experience was not only enriching from a scientific point of view as I could discover new methods and applications, but it was also a actual pleasure to meet scientist from all over the world, discover Malaysian culture and traditions !

Many thanks to the organizers to make it possible, hopefully to see you all in another ICIP !
