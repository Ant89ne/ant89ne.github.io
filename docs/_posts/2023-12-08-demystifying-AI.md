<div style="text-align: justify">
As part of the day of numeric and computer science in France, three colleagues and I were involved in vulgarizing our works to demystify our practices for all.

<br/>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Following presentations introducing our works and the pros and cons of our numerical world in a highschool in Bourg Saint-Maurice, we were invited by the "Campus Connecté" to introduce and explain artificial intelligence for all.

More than an introduction to AI, the objective was to answer common questions which are rising with the recent evolution of AI and the release of Chat-GPT. "Are our past knowledge useless now?", "Is an algorithm able to write an algorithm?" and the most important : "What do we call intelligence?". It was extremely enriching to discuss and argue about AI.
