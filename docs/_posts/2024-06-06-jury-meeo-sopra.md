This Thursday 6th of June 2024 was for me a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to serve as the jury member of a coding competition.

<div style="text-align: justify">
The Sopra Steria company together with the <a href = "https://www.ecole-meeo.com/"> MEEO </a> (Mon Ã‰cole Extra-Ordinaire) school organized a competition where 10 young neuro-atypical children compete in creating their own labyrinth game with the Scratch coding language.
Starting from a baseline code, the children were then invited to be creative to customize their own labyrinth game.
Hidden ways, homemade soundtracks, treasure hunter and visual effects, all strategies were allowed to be the best of the best!

Following a long and difficult deliberation, we - the members of the jury - succeeded to deliver 10 different prizes to congratulate the child for their impressive works.

It was a real pleasure to participate to this competition and to discover the amazing games created by the children!
