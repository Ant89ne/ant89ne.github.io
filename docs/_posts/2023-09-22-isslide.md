<div style="text-align: justify">
I am thrilled to announce the creation of a new dataset entitled ISSLIDE: InSAR dataset for Slow SLIding area DEtection available on <a href ="https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/isslide-insar-dataset-slow-sliding-area-detection-machine-learning">IEEE Dataport</a>.
</div>
<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify">
The dataset is two-folds:
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li> A raw interferogram dataset </li>
<li> A deep learning ready-to-be-used dataset </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
The raw dataset contains the whole interferograms as well as the shapefiles of the manually annotated landslides. Its objective is to be used for enrichment purpose or for the user to compute its own landslide patch extraction.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">
The ready-to-be-used dataset is already processed. 13.230 patches of phase difference and coherence were croped around the existing moves. The shapefiles are transformed into binary masks to facilitate deep learning applications.

Further details are available on  <a href ="https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/isslide-insar-dataset-slow-sliding-area-detection-machine-learning">IEEE Dataport</a> and if you have any troubles with the dataset, do not hesitate to contact me.
