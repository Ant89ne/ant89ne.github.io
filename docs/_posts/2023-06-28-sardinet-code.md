Last October, I was glad to announce the publication of my first paper as part of my PhD studies. Indeed, SARDINet, a neural network capable to translate a SAR image containing geometrical distorsions into an optical image was published in ICIP 2022.
<br/>
It demonstrated sigificant improvements with regards to the results obtained by classical adversarial translation methods and shown robustness toward radiometrical and geometrical distorsions.

<br/><br/>

You can find the paper following the link : <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9897713">Deep Learning of Radiometrical and Geometrical Sar Distorsions for Image Modality translations</a>.

<br/><br/>

<center><font size=5> I am pleased here to announce that the code of SARDINet is now available on <a href="https://github.com/Ant89ne/SARDINet">GitHub</a> !</font></center>

<br/>

If you are interested in running it, testing it or even improving it, do not hesitate ! And if you have any questions with regards to the paper or the code, please send me a message !
