# A bit more about me...


## ... as a student

## ... as a researcher

## ... as a teacher

## ... as a collegue


## ... as a person

I'm passionnated of computer science in its whole but as previous sections show : especially in **image processing** !

Video games creations, micro-doppler spectrograms, medical MRI and tomographies and now remote sensing images, so many fields I was glad to discover deeper inside.

If I did not have any background on the topic before my experiences, my curiosity and adaptability helped me to associate my skills in **image and signal processing** as well as in **Machine and Deep Learning** to all these applications. 

But life is not made only of works ! Hiking, swimming, cycling and sometimes bouldering are so many activities I like to share with friends and collegues especially within Annecy nowadays !
