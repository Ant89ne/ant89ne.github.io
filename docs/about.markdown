# ... as a student

Following the obtention of my scientific Baccalaureate and my preparatory school in Math and Physics, I integrated CPE Lyon (France) engineering school in Maths and Physics. Among my engineering years, I could specialized in Image and Signal Processing, Modeling and Computer Science. Following my gap year, I followed a double diploma cursus : finishing my engineering school and integrating the master Image and Development in 3D (ID3D) in University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.

In 2020, I get graduated both of my engineering school and my master. I then started in October 2020 my PhD in the LISTIC lab in Annecy on :

I'm passionnated of computer science in its whole but as previous sections show : especially in **image processing** !

Video games creations, micro-doppler spectrograms, medical MRI and tomographies and now remote sensing images, so many fields I was glad to discover deeper inside. If I did not have any background on the topic before my experiences, my curiosity and adaptability helped me to associate my skills in **image and signal processing** as well as in **Machine and Deep Learning** to all these applications. 

But life is not made only of works ! Hiking, swimming, cycling and sometimes bouldering are so many activities I like to share with friends and collegues especially around Annecy nowadays !
