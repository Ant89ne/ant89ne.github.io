# ... as a student

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Following the obtention of my scientific Baccalaureate and my preparatory school in Math and Physics, I integrated CPE Lyon (France) engineering school in Maths and Physics. Among my engineering years, I could specialized in Image and Signal Processing, Modeling and Computer Science. Following my gap year, I followed a double diploma cursus : finishing my engineering school and integrating the master Image and Development in 3D (ID3D) in University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
<br/><br/>
In 2020, I get graduated both of my engineering school and my master. I then started on the 1st October 2020 my PhD in the LISTIC lab in Annecy on : "Deep Learning for Multimodal Detection of Sudden and Slow Moving Slope Instabilities on Bitemporal Remote Sensing Images" and defended successfully on the 1st October 2024.

# ... as a researcher

<div style="text-align: justify">

My researches are mainly based on <b>image processing and machine/deep learning</b>. I am used to adapt my knowledge in the field to any domain after learning its specificities. The range of applications of my work is wide : video games when I was in engineering school, micro-doppler radar wave signal analysis in TNO (Netherlands), medical images in CREATIS (France) and now remote sensing images in LISTIC Lab (France). After figuring out the specificities, limitations and constraints, I adapt my methodologies to the data, expectations and objectives. Here are some keywords describing the methodologies I set in place: Domain Adaptation, Multi-Modality, Conditionned Networks, Modality Translation and Explainability-Constrained Networks.

# ... as a teacher

<div style="text-align: justify">

During my PhD years, I am used to give courses to students in Polytech Annecy-Chambery and in the Institut Universitaire Technologique in Annecy. From Embedding Computer Science to Statistical Analysis, from Computer Science and Algorithms in Python to Deep Learning, I am used to vulgarize my researches and the concepts to send the most relevant messages. As a matter of fact, I also participated at the French version of My Thesis in 180 seconds to help me vulgarizing scientific notions and spread more easily complex concepts.

# ... as a person

<div style="text-align: justify">

I'm passionnated by computer science in its whole but as previous sections show : especially in <b>image processing</b> !
<br/><br/>
Video games creations, micro-doppler spectrograms, medical MRI and tomographies and now remote sensing images, so many fields I was glad to discover deeper inside. If I did not have any background on the topic before my experiences, my curiosity and adaptability helped me to associate my skills in <b>image and signal processing</b> as well as in <b>Machine and Deep Learning</b> to all these applications. 
<br/><br>
But life is not made only of works ! Hiking, swimming, cycling and sometimes bouldering are so many activities I like to share with friends and collegues especially around Annecy nowadays !
